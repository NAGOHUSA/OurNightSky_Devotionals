The trees stand bare, their branches etched against the grey horizon like a delicate pen and ink drawing. Yet, in this stillness, God's presence is palpable. The stars shine with a fierce clarity, unobscured by the foliage of warmer months. The moon, a silver crescent, glows with a gentle light, illuminating the path ahead. In this season of quiet, we're reminded that God's power and nature are always on display, even when the world around us appears dormant.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we walk through the winter season, help us to see beyond the surface level of creation. May we catch glimpses of your eternal power and divine nature in the stars, the moon, and the silent landscape. Remind us that your presence is always with us, even in the stillness. Help us to trust in your sovereignty and to find comfort in the knowledge that you are always at work, even when we can't see it. May our hearts be filled with wonder and our spirits be lifted by the beauty of your creation. Amen.",
