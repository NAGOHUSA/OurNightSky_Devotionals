The phases of the moon, the orbits of planets, and the dance of stars all point to a larger harmony. In the same way, our lives are part of a greater rhythm, one that ebbs and flows with God's grace. Just as the tides respond to the moon's gravitational pull, our hearts respond to the gentle tug of God's love. In the story of Noah, we see a powerful example of God's remembering and rescuing his people. As the floodwaters receded, a new creation emerged, full of promise and possibility.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, thank you for the cosmic rhythms that remind us of your faithfulness. Help us to attune our hearts to the gentle tug of your love, and to trust in your sovereign plan. Just as the universe responds to your guidance, may our lives be responsive to your grace. May we find comfort in the knowledge that you remember us, and that you are always working to bring us into a new creation, full of promise and possibility. Amen.",
