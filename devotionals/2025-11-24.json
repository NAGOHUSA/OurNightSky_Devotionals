From ancient astronomers to modern-day stargazers, humans have been driven to understand and navigate the vast expanse of the universe. Yet, in our quest for knowledge, we often forget that the ultimate Cartographer is God Himself. He has woven a tapestry of stars, planets, and galaxies that declare His glory and proclaim the work of His hands.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the celestial map You have created, we are reminded of Your infinite wisdom and power. Help us to see beyond the stars and constellations to the glory of Your character. May our lives be a reflection of Your majestic design, and may we navigate the journey of faith with the confidence that You are our ultimate Guide. As we explore the wonders of the universe, may our hearts be filled with awe and reverence for You, the Celestial Cartographer who has mapped out a plan of salvation for humanity. Amen.",
