He has also set eternity in the human heart; yet no one can fathom what God has done from beginning to end.\" - Ecclesiastes 3:11\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze upon the celestial expanse, we are reminded of the intricate harmony that governs our universe. The planets orbit in precise rhythm, the stars shine in measured cadence, and the galaxies dance in majestic symphony. This cosmic harmony is a reflection of God's beautiful design, where every detail, every movement, and every moment is carefully orchestrated. Just as the seasons on Earth follow a predictable pattern, our lives also undergo cycles of growth, transformation, and renewal. In the midst of life's uncertainties, we can find comfort in the eternal rhythm of God's plan, which whispers to us of a beauty and purpose that transcends time.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we ponder the majesty of your creation, we are reminded of the symphony of faith that governs our lives. Help us to discern the rhythm of your plan, to trust in the beauty of your design, and to find comfort in the eternal harmony that underlies all of existence. May our hearts be filled with wonder, our spirits be lifted with joy, and our souls be nourished by the knowledge of your infinite love and sovereignty. Amen.",
