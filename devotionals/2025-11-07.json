With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ.\" - Ephesians 1:7-9\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze upon the starry night sky, we are reminded of the infinite wisdom and grace of our Creator. Just as the stars twinkle with a light that has traveled vast distances to reach us, God's wisdom and plan for our lives have been in motion since the beginning of time. The celestial ballet, with its intricate dance of planets and stars, reflects the complexity and beauty of God's design. As we navigate the complexities of our own lives, we can trust in God's eternal wisdom and redemption, knowing that He has lavished us with His grace and made known to us the mystery of His will.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of the starry night sky, we are reminded of Your infinite wisdom and grace. Help us to trust in Your plan for our lives, even when the path ahead seems uncertain. Lavish us with Your presence and guide us with Your wisdom, that we may reflect Your light and love to a world in need. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.",
