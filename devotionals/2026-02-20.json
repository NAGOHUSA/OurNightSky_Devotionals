The stars, planets, and galaxies serve as signs, marking the passage of time and pointing us to the sacred rhythms of God's creation. Just as the morning star heralds the dawn of a new day, Jesus, the Light of the World, bridges the gap between our temporal existence and the eternal realm. In Him, we find the promise of eternal life, where every moment is infused with purpose and meaning.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the celestial wonders of Your creation, we're humbled by the vast expanse of Your love and sovereignty. Help us to see the bridges that connect our daily lives to the eternal realm, and may we walk in the light of Jesus, our Morning Star. May His radiance illuminate our path, guiding us through life's journey, and may we find comfort in the promise of eternal life, where every moment is filled with Your presence and glory. Amen.",
