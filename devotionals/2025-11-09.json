Which of all these does not know that the hand of the Lord has done this?\" - Job 12:7-9\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the autumn night sky, we're reminded of the breathtaking beauty of God's creation. The stars twinkling like diamonds against the dark canvas of space, the Milky Way stretching across the horizon, and the constellations telling stories of old. But creation's beauty is not just limited to the celestial realm. The changing leaves, the migration of birds, and the harvest season all point to the majesty of our Creator. Just as the animals, birds, and fish know the hand of the Lord, we too can learn from the natural world and be in awe of God's sovereignty over all creation.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of your creation, we're reminded of your infinite power and wisdom. Help us to see your hand in every aspect of nature, from the stars in the sky to the leaves on the trees. May we learn from the natural world and be drawn closer to you, our Creator and Savior. Thank you for the gift of creation, and may we steward it well, glorifying you in all we do. Amen.",
