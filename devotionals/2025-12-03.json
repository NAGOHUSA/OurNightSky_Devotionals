The planets, stars, and galaxies all work together in a beautiful cosmic harmony, each one playing its part in the grand symphony of the universe. This harmony is a reflection of God's redemption, where all things are being brought together under the lordship of Christ. Just as the stars and planets move in their orbits, our lives are also being orchestrated by God to fulfill His purposes. We are not isolated individuals, but part of a larger cosmic story, connected to all of creation and to each other.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of Your creation, remind us of our place in the grand story of redemption. Help us to see how our lives fit into the larger cosmic harmony, and how we can fulfill our part in the symphony of Your plan. May we be in awe of Your sovereignty over all creation, and may our hearts be filled with wonder and gratitude for the beauty and complexity of the universe You have made. Amen.",
