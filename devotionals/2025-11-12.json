The position of stars, planets, and galaxies is carefully mapped and interconnected. This celestial cartography speaks to the order and harmony that God has established in the universe. Just as a skilled cartographer charts the terrain of the earth, God has mapped out the vast expanse of creation, sustaining all things by His powerful word. In the same way, our lives are part of a larger narrative, connected to the story of God's redemption and glory.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of the night sky, we're reminded of Your power and wisdom. Help us to see our place within the larger story of Your creation, and to trust in Your sovereignty over all things. Just as the stars and planets move in harmony, may our lives be guided by Your word and sustained by Your presence. May we reflect the radiance of Your glory, shining as lights in a world that needs Your love and hope. Amen.",
