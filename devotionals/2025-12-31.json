The stars and constellations before us have witnessed countless seasons come and go, yet their twinkling light remains a constant reminder of God's faithfulness. Just as the morning sun gradually illuminates the horizon, our journey with God is one of increasing light and understanding. As we navigate life's joys and challenges, we can trust that God's wisdom and love will guide us, shining ever brighter till the full light of day.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we embark on a new year, we thank you for the eternal horizon that stretches out before us. Help us to trust in your faithfulness and to walk in the increasing light of your love. May the stars and constellations remind us of your promise to guide us, and may we reflect your light to a world in need. Shine your light upon us, that we may shine for you, and may our path be filled with the warmth and joy of your presence. Amen.",
