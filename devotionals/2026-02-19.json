The stars and galaxies beyond our reach can evoke a sense of awe and wonder. Yet, as believers, we're called to look beyond the cosmic veil, to the One who has called us out of darkness into His wonderful light. Just as the aurora borealis dances across the polar skies, God's radiant presence illuminates our lives, guiding us through the darkest nights. We're not just stargazers; we're children of the King, chosen to declare His praises to a world in need of light.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, thank You for calling us out of darkness into Your wonderful light. As we marvel at the beauty of the night sky, remind us of our royal priesthood, our holy nation status, and our special possession as Your children. Help us to declare Your praises to a world in need, that others may be drawn to Your radiant presence. May our lives shine like the morning star, reflecting Your glory and guiding those around us to the path of salvation. Amen.",
