The stars and galaxies stretch out before us like a canvas of endless possibility, a reflection of the eternal pleasures that await us in God's presence. Just as the universe is vast and expansive, God's love and joy are boundless, waiting to be explored and experienced by us. As we navigate the phases of our faith journey, we can take comfort in the promise of eternal life, where every moment will be filled with joy and wonder.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we ponder the vast expanse of your creation, we're reminded of the infinite nature of your love and joy. Fill us with a sense of wonder and awe as we contemplate the eternal pleasures that await us in your presence. Guide us on the path of life, that we may walk in the light of your joy, and may our hearts be filled with the promise of eternal life, where every moment will be filled with your joy and wonder. Amen.",
