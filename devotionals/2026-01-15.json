The shooting stars of meteor showers whisper to us of the brief, shining moments we have to reflect God's glory. Yet, even in the brevity of life, we find eternal purpose. Just as comets streak across the sky, leaving behind a glowing trail, our lives can leave a lasting impact when lived for God's glory. The depths of space remind us that our lives are but a small part of a much larger story, one written by the Creator of the universe.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of the night sky, help us to remember that our lives have eternal purpose. May we shine brightly for You, even in the fleeting moments we have on this earth. Guide us to live each day with intention, leaving a trail of love, kindness, and devotion to You. As we navigate the complexities of life, remind us that You have made everything for its own purpose, and that Your sovereignty reigns over all creation. May our lives be a reflection of Your glory, and may we trust in Your eternal plan. Amen.",
