The planets orbit, the stars shine, and the moon waxes and wanes - all in perfect harmony. Just as the universe has its rhythms, our lives also have a rhythm of rest and activity. In a world that often values busyness and productivity, it's easy to forget the importance of rest. But God, in His wisdom, commands us to rest and observe the Sabbath. As we slow down and tune into the celestial rhythms, we're reminded that rest is not a luxury, but a necessity. It's in these moments of stillness that we can feel God's face shining on us, His grace and peace enveloping us.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, help us to tune into the celestial rhythms of rest and activity. May we remember that rest is a gift from You, and that it's in these moments of stillness that we can feel Your presence and peace. Shine Your face on us, and be gracious to us. Turn Your face toward us, and give us peace. May our lives be in harmony with Your rhythm, and may we find rest in Your loving presence. Amen.",
