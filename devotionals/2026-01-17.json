The stars and galaxies stretch out before us, a reminder of the infinite possibilities that lie beyond our present circumstances. Just as the universe is expanding and evolving, our lives are also unfolding according to God's plan. In the midst of uncertainty and challenge, we can find hope in the promise that God has a future in store for us, one that is filled with purpose and prosperity.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we stand at the threshold of a new year, we look to the cosmic horizon and remember that your plans for us are filled with hope and promise. Help us to trust in your goodness and sovereignty, even when the path ahead is unclear. May the vastness of the universe remind us of the infinite possibilities that lie before us, and may your promise of a hopeful future guide us forward, filling our hearts with joy and our spirits with courage. Amen.",
