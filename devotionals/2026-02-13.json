Day after day they pour forth speech; night after night they reveal knowledge. They have no speech, they use no words; no sound is heard from them. Yet their voice goes out into all the earth, their words to the ends of the world.\"\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the night sky, we're met with a breathtaking symphony of creation. The stars, planets, and galaxies all work together in perfect harmony, each playing their unique role in the grand orchestra of the universe. This celestial music is a reflection of God's character, revealing His glory and majesty to all who will listen. Just as a skilled composer weaves together disparate notes and melodies to create a beautiful work of art, God has woven together the intricate threads of creation to declare His praise.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we contemplate the wonders of the night sky, we're reminded of Your incredible creativity and craftsmanship. Help us to hear the music of the spheres, to discern the voice of Your creation proclaiming Your glory. May our hearts be filled with wonder, awe, and reverence for You, the Master Composer of the universe. May we join in the celestial harmony, singing Your praise and declaring Your glory to all the world.",
