The Milky Way, a glowing ribbon of stars, stretches across the horizon, symbolizing the infinite connections between God, humanity, and the universe. Just as the Milky Way bridges the gap between stars and galaxies, God's love bridges the gap between our struggles and His hope. In times of need, we can find comfort in the promise that God will never forget the afflicted, and our hope will never perish.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of the Milky Way, remind us of the celestial bridges that connect us to Your love and hope. In times of struggle, help us to look up to the stars and remember that You are always with us, bridging the gaps between our fears and Your promises. Fill us with the hope of the afflicted, and may our hearts be filled with the assurance that You will never forget us. May we reflect Your love and hope to a world in need, just as the stars reflect Your glory in the night sky. Amen.",
