The stars, planets, and galaxies all resonate with a harmonious frequency, reflecting the glory of God. Just as the Earth's oceans cover the sea floor, God's knowledge and glory will one day fill the entire earth. This promise echoes through the chambers of our hearts, inviting us to resonate with His celestial song. As we tune our lives to His frequency, we begin to reflect His glory, shining like stars in the night sky.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, we thank You for the celestial resonance that fills the universe. Help us to tune our hearts to Your frequency, that we may reflect Your glory and shine like stars in the darkness. Fill us with the knowledge of Your glory, that we may be a harmonious part of Your celestial song. As we gaze upon the winter sky, remind us of Your promise to fill the earth with Your glory, and give us the courage to resonate with Your love and light. Amen.",
