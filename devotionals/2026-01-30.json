The stars have long been a symbol of guidance and direction, leading us to our destination. In our spiritual journey, we have a celestial Guide who is always with us, guiding us through the ups and downs of life. Jesus, our High Priest, has sworn to be with us forever, a constant presence in our lives. Just as the stars remain fixed in the sky, Jesus' promise to us remains unwavering.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, thank you for the celestial wonders that remind us of your faithfulness and guidance. Help us to fix our eyes on Jesus, our celestial Guide, as we navigate the journey of life. May we trust in your sovereignty and promises, just as the stars trust in their celestial orbits. May we be encouraged by the knowledge that Jesus is with us always, a priest forever, interceding on our behalf. Shine your light upon us, Lord, and guide us on our pilgrimage to eternal life with you. Amen.",
