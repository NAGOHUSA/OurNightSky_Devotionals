Each one is uniquely woven into the fabric of our universe, playing its own vital role in the grand symphony of creation. Just as a skilled weaver carefully intertwines threads to create a beautiful work of art, God has intricately designed the celestial world to reflect His glory. The planets orbit, the stars shine, and the galaxies swirl – all sustaining each other in a delicate dance of gravity and light. In the same way, Jesus Christ, the Son of God, sustains all things by His powerful word, holding the universe together with His divine presence.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of the celestial tapestry, remind us of Your infinite power and wisdom. Help us to see the intricate web of relationships within Your creation, and how each part plays a vital role in the grand story of redemption. May we be in awe of Your glory, as reflected in the stars and galaxies, and may our hearts be filled with wonder and praise for the sustaining power of Jesus Christ.",
