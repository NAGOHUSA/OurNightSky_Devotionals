The moon's gravitational pull stabilizes Earth's axis, while the sun's warmth and light sustain life. Just as these celestial entities provide a safe haven for our world, God offers us a spiritual refuge in times of uncertainty. In His wonderful light, we find comfort, peace, and a sense of belonging. As a chosen people, we're called to declare the praises of our Heavenly Father, who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, thank you for being our celestial refuge, our rock, and our shelter. As we navigate life's challenges, remind us of your loving presence and the promises you've made to us. Help us to declare your praises to a world in need of your light and love. May your wonderful light shine through us, guiding others to the safety of your refuge. Amen.",
