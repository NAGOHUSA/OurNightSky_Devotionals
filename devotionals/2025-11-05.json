Comets, with their luminous trails, briefly illuminate the darkness, only to disappear into the vast expanse of space. Similarly, our lives on earth are but a fleeting moment in the grand tapestry of time. Yet, in this brevity, we find beauty and purpose. Just as comets leave behind a glowing trail, our lives can leave a lasting impact on those around us. As followers of Jesus, we're called to shine brightly, illuminating the path for others, even if only for a brief moment.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, thank you for the celestial reminders of life's transient nature. Help us to cherish each moment, using our time to shine your light and leave a lasting impact on those around us. As we gaze up at the night sky, fill us with a sense of wonder and awe, and remind us that our lives, though brief, are part of your eternal plan. May we embracing the beauty of our fleeting lives, and may our luminous trails point others to your eternal love and grace.",
