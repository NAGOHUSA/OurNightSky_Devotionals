The earth's tilt has brought us to a season of quiet and contemplation, where the stillness of the night air invites us to reflect on the majesty of God's creation. Just as the stars silently witness to God's eternal power, our lives can be a testament to His divine nature. As we navigate the darkness of winter, we can find comfort in the fact that God's presence is not limited by the seasons, but is always at work, shaping and guiding us.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of the winter sky, remind us of Your eternal power and divine nature. Help us to be still and know that You are God, even in the quiet darkness of winter. May our lives be a reflection of Your majesty, and may we be a silent witness to Your love and presence in the world. Shine Your light through us, that others may see Your glory and be drawn to You. Amen.",
