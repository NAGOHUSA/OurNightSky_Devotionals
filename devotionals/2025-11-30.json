He received honor and glory from God the Father when the voice came to him from the Majestic Glory, saying, 'This is my Son, whom I love; with him I am well pleased.' We ourselves heard this voice that came from heaven when we were with him on the sacred mountain. And we have the word of the prophets made more certain, and you will do well to pay attention to it, as to a light shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star rises in your hearts.\" - 2 Peter 1:16-19\n\n## Reflection\nAs the morning star rises in the night sky, it brings hope to those who have been waiting in darkness. Similarly, Jesus is our morning star, shining brightly in the darkness of our lives. He is the light that guides us, comforts us, and fills us with hope. Just as the morning star signals the approaching dawn, Jesus signals the approaching dawn of eternal life. As we navigate the challenges of this life, we can look to Jesus as our constant source of hope and guidance.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, we thank you for the gift of Jesus, our morning star. May his light shine brightly in our hearts, guiding us through life's challenges and filling us with hope. Help us to pay attention to your word, which is a light shining in a dark place. May we wait patiently for the dawn of eternal life, knowing that Jesus is always with us, shining brightly as our morning star. Amen.",
