The Milky Way, a glittering river of stars, stretches across the velvet blackness, a testament to God's infinite power and majesty. Yet, beyond the reaches of our galaxy, lies a vast unknown, a veil that separates us from the unseen realms of the universe. Just as the galactic veil hides the secrets of the cosmos, our own lives can be shrouded in darkness, uncertainty, and fear. But as children of God, we are called out of this darkness into the wonderful light of His presence.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we ponder the mysteries of the universe, remind us that You are the One who calls us out of darkness into Your marvelous light. Help us to declare Your praises, even in the face of uncertainty, and to trust in Your sovereign power over all creation. May we be beacons of hope, shining brightly in a world still shrouded in darkness, and may Your light guide us as we journey through the vast expanse of life. Amen.",
