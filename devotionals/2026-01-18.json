On the earth, nations will be in anguish and perplexity at the roaring and tossing of the sea.\" - Luke 21:25\n\n## Reflection\nAs we observe the phases of the moon, we're reminded of the cycles of faith in our lives. Just as the moon waxes and wanes, our spiritual journeys ebb and flow. There are times of fullness, when God's presence is palpable, and times of emptiness, when we feel lost and uncertain. Yet, even in the darkest moments, God's light is still present, shining like the faint glow of a new moon. The celestial cycles teach us to trust in God's sovereignty, to wait patiently for the tide to turn, and to trust that He is working all things for our good.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we navigate the ups and downs of life, help us to find comfort in the celestial cycles. Remind us that Your presence is constant, even when our circumstances change. May we trust in Your goodness and sovereignty, just as the moon trusts in the Sun's gravitational pull. Fill our hearts with hope and peace, knowing that You are the Rock that holds us steady, no matter the phase of our journey. Shine Your light in our darkness, and guide us through the ebbs and flows of life, that we may glorify You in all things. Amen.",
