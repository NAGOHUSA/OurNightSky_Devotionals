The planets, governed by God's sovereign laws, demonstrate His faithfulness in maintaining the delicate balance of our universe. Just as the orbits of the planets are predetermined and consistent, God's promises to us are unwavering and faithful. In a world filled with uncertainty, we can find comfort in the reliability of God's character.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the celestial wonders You've created, we're reminded of Your faithfulness to all Your promises. Help us to trust in Your sovereignty, just as the planets trust in the laws that govern their motion. May we find comfort in Your unwavering character and reliability, even in the midst of uncertainty. Thank You for being a God who is loving toward all He has made, and who keeps His promises to us. May our hearts be filled with wonder, gratitude, and trust in Your faithfulness. Amen.",
