And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes.” - Revelation 7:17\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the night sky, the phases of the moon remind us of the seasons of our faith journey. Just as the moon waxes and wanes, our relationship with God ebbs and flows. In the fullness of our faith, we shine bright, reflecting the light of Christ. But in the darkness of doubt and uncertainty, we may feel lost and alone. Yet, even in the lunar cycle's darkest phase, the moon is still present, waiting for the sun's light to illuminate it once more. Similarly, God's presence remains with us, even in the darkest seasons of our lives.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, thank you for the reminder that you are always with us, even in the darkest phases of our faith journey. Help us to trust in your presence and guidance, just as the moon trusts in the sun's light to illuminate it. Lead us to the springs of living water, and wipe away every tear from our eyes. May we reflect the light of Christ, even in the darkest times, and may your love and peace shine bright in our hearts. Amen.",
