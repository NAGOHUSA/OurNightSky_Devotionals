Just as comets streak across the celestial canvas, our lives are brief, yet filled with eternal purpose. We are pilgrims, navigating the twists and turns of faith, called to declare the praises of God who has brought us out of darkness into His wonderful light. The Milky Way, a majestic river of stars, reminds us of our place in God's vast plan, connected to all that is and all that will be.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we traverse the journey of life, help us to stay focused on Your wonderful light. May we navigate the darkest nights with the assurance of Your presence, and may our lives shine like comets, illuminating the path for others to follow. Thank You for choosing us as Your special possession, a royal priesthood, called to declare Your praises to a world in need of Your light. Guide us on our cosmic pilgrimage, that we may fulfill our eternal purpose and bring glory to Your name. Amen.",
