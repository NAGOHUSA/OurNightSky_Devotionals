I said, 'You are my servant'; I have chosen you and have not rejected you.\" - Isaiah 41:8-9\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the starry night sky, we are reminded of God's promise to Abraham, that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars. This promise, made to a single individual, has been fulfilled in the most extraordinary way, with the nation of Israel and the global community of believers today. The stars above testify to God's faithfulness, a reminder that He keeps His promises and is always true to His word. Just as the stars remain steadfast in the night sky, God's love and commitment to us remain unwavering.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of the starry night sky, we are reminded of Your faithfulness to Your people. Help us to trust in Your promises, just as Abraham did, and to rest in the knowledge that You are always with us. May the stars above inspire us to live lives that reflect Your glory and to share Your love with a world in need. Thank You for choosing us and for being our Rock and Redeemer. Amen.",
