Then he said to him, 'So shall your offspring be.'\" - Genesis 15:5\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the starry night sky, we are reminded of God's promise to Abraham, that his descendants would be as numerous as the stars. This promise was not just a statement of fact, but a testament to God's faithfulness and sovereignty over all creation. Just as the stars guide travelers on their journey, God's promises guide us through the ups and downs of life. As we navigate the twists and turns of our own pilgrimage, we can look to the stars and remember that we are not alone. God is our constant companion, leading us towards a brighter future.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we look up at the starry night sky, we are reminded of your faithfulness and promise-keeping nature. Help us to trust in your guidance and sovereignty, even when the path ahead is uncertain. May the stars be a reminder to us of your infinite love and care for us, and may we reflect your light to a world in need. Amen.",
