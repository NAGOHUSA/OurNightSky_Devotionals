The universe, with all its complexity and grandeur, is a testament to His boundless power and creativity. From the swirling galaxies to the intricate dance of planetary orbits, every aspect of creation declares His majesty. Just as a resume highlights a person's achievements and qualifications, the universe serves as God's cosmic resume, showcasing His abilities as the Master Creator.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the vast expanse of Your creation, we're humbled by Your greatness. Help us to see Your handiwork in every star, every planet, and every galaxy. May our faith be strengthened as we recognize Your invisible hand guiding the visible universe. Just as Your cosmic resume is filled with wonders, may our lives be filled with the wonder of knowing You. Give us a deeper appreciation for Your creative genius and a greater trust in Your sovereign plan. Amen.",
