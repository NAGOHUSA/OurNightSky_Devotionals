The stars and galaxies that stretch out before us are a testament to His eternal power and wisdom. In a world where everything is constantly changing, it's comforting to know that God remains the same. His character, His love, and His promises are unshakeable and unwavering. Just as the laws of physics that govern the universe are constant, God's Word is constant and reliable. As we navigate the uncertainties of life, we can anchor our hopes and dreams in the eternal nature of our Creator.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of deep space, we are reminded of Your infinite nature and eternal power. Help us to trust in Your unchanging character and to anchor our lives in Your Word. May we find comfort and peace in the knowledge that You are the same yesterday, today, and forever. Guide us as we explore the wonders of Your creation, and may our hearts be filled with awe and reverence for You. Amen.",
