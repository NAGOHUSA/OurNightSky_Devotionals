The sun sets earlier, and the moon casts a gentle glow over the landscape. Yet, in the midst of this seasonal darkness, we find a profound truth: God's presence is our eternal light. Just as the city in Revelation 21:23 is illuminated by the glory of God, our lives are radiant with the light of Christ. The winter season invites us to look beyond the ephemeral nature of earthly light and to behold the eternal radiance of God's presence.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we navigate the darker months of winter, remind us that Your presence is our constant light. Help us to look beyond the fleeting nature of earthly illumination and to behold the eternal glory of Your presence. May our lives reflect the light of Christ, shining brightly for all to see. As we marvel at the winter sky, may we be drawn closer to the radiance of Your love, and may our hearts be filled with the warmth of Your presence. Amen.",
