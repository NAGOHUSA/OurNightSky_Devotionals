You discern my going out and my lying down; you are familiar with all my ways.\" - Psalm 139:1-3\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the night sky, we're reminded of the vast expanse of God's creation. The stars and galaxies above are like a celestial archive, storing memories of the past and present. Just as astronomers use these archives to understand the universe, God has an intimate knowledge of our lives, storing every moment, thought, and emotion in His heart. The Psalmist's words reassure us that we're not just specks in an vast universe, but uniquely known and loved by our Creator.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we ponder the wonders of the night sky, we're humbled by Your omniscience and love. Help us to remember that every moment of our lives is stored in Your archives, and that You're always with us, guiding and directing our paths. May we find comfort in Your familiarity with our ways, and may our lives reflect the beauty and wonder of Your celestial creation. Amen.",
