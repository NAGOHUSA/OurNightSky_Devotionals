As Venus (Evening Star), Mars, Jupiter shine above, we're reminded that God has numbered every star and calls each by name. In this autumn evening, let the vastness of creation draw your heart to the intimate love of our Creator. The same God who set the celestial bodies in motion cares deeply for your every need. Take a moment to step outside during 9:00 pm - 11:00 pm local time and let the night sky remind you of promises that never fail. Tonight's special feature, venus appears as the brilliant evening star, serves as a gentle reminder that divine order persists even when our world feels chaotic. Rest in the knowledge that the One who created this magnificent display holds you in perfect love.",
