The constellations, like old friends, reappear in the sky, guiding us through the seasons. Just as a cartographer charts the terrain of our world, God has mapped out the vast expanse of the universe, assigning each star and planet its place in the grand scheme. This celestial cartography speaks to God's sovereignty and attention to detail, reassuring us that our lives are not without purpose or direction.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the starry sky, we're awestruck by your creative genius and faithfulness. Help us to navigate life's journey with the same sense of wonder and trust that comes from gazing at the celestial map you've created. Just as the constellations guide us through the seasons, may your Word and Spirit guide us through life's challenges, reminding us of your love and care for us. May we declare your glory and proclaim the work of your hands to a world in need of your light and direction.",
