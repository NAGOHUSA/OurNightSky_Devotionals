The flickering embers of distant suns whisper tales of God's creative power. Just as the lights in the sky mark sacred times and seasons, our lives are also punctuated by moments of significance. We experience seasons of growth, periods of rest, and times of celebration. In the stillness of winter, we're invited to reflect on the rhythms of our faith journey. How are we responding to God's gentle nudges, his whispers of guidance, and his radiant light?\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the twinkling lights in the winter sky, we're reminded of your majestic sovereignty over all creation. Help us to attune our hearts to the rhythms of your grace, to embrace the seasons of our faith journey, and to trust in your guidance. May the flickering embers of your love illuminate our path, warming our hearts and inspiring us to walk in harmony with your plan. Amen.",
