They've identified patterns and created charts to help us navigate the vast expanse of the universe. But despite our best efforts, we're still only scratching the surface of God's creation. The scripture reminds us that God's thoughts and ways are far beyond our own, just as the heavens are higher than the earth. This mystery is both humbling and awe-inspiring, inviting us to trust in God's sovereignty over all creation.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the night sky, we're reminded of the vastness of your creation and the depths of your wisdom. Help us to trust in your ways, even when they seem mysterious or beyond our understanding. Give us the humility to recognize our limitations and the faith to rely on your guidance. May we be drawn closer to you as we contemplate the wonders of the universe, and may our hearts be filled with awe and reverence for your greatness. Amen.",
