He gives the sea its boundaries and puts the stars in their places.\" - Job 38:12, and Psalm 104:12, however a more fitting scripture is: \"He determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name.\" - Psalm 147:4\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the night sky during the winter season, we're reminded of the incredible migration patterns of celestial bodies. Just as the stars and constellations move in their designated paths, our lives are also on a journey of faith. We may not always understand the twists and turns, but God is the orchestrator of our paths. The Bible reminds us that God determines the number of the stars and calls them each by name. This same God who has named the stars has a unique plan for each of us, guiding us through the seasons of life.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the wonder of the night sky, remind us that our lives are part of a larger cosmic story. Help us trust in Your sovereignty, knowing that You have named each star and have a plan for our lives. Guide us on our journey of faith, and may we find comfort in Your guidance, even when the path ahead is uncertain. Amen.",
