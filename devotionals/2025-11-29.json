A town built on a hill cannot be hidden.\" - Matthew 5:14\n\n## Reflection\nAs we navigate the journey of life, we often find ourselves in unfamiliar territories, searching for direction and guidance. Just as the evening star serves as a beacon in the night sky, Jesus is the light that illuminates our path. In the Fall season, as the days grow shorter and the nights grow longer, we are reminded of the importance of holding onto the light of Christ. The constellations above, with their ancient patterns and rhythms, whisper to us of God's faithfulness and presence in our lives.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we journey through the ups and downs of life, help us to fix our eyes on the light of Christ. May we reflect Your glory and shine like stars in a dark world. As we gaze up at the night sky, fill us with wonder and awe at the vastness of Your creation. May the starlight guide us on our path, reminding us of Your promise to always be with us, and may our lives be a testament to the light of Your love. Amen.",
