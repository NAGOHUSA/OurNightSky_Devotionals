And we eagerly await a Savior from there, the Lord Jesus Christ, who, by the power that enables him to bring everything under his control, will transform our lowly bodies so that they will be like his glorious body.\" - Philippians 3:20-21\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the night sky, we're struck by the majestic dance of celestial bodies. Planets, stars, and galaxies move in perfect harmony, each one playing its part in the grand symphony of creation. This celestial choreography is a testament to God's sovereignty over all creation. Just as the universe is subject to God's control, our lives are also under His gentle guidance. We can trust that He is working everything out for our good, transforming us into the likeness of Christ.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of the night sky, remind us of Your sovereign power and gentle guidance in our lives. Help us to trust in Your plan and timing, even when we don't understand the twists and turns of our journey. Transform us by Your power, that we may reflect the glory of Christ and shine like stars in the darkness. May our lives be a testament to Your celestial choreography, moving in harmony with Your will. Amen.",
