Yet, even in the darkness, starlight still shines through. This phenomenon reminds us of God's presence in our lives, even in the most challenging times. Just as the stars continue to shine despite the darkness, God's love and guidance remain constant, unaffected by our circumstances. The stars also remind us of God's sovereignty over all creation, as they obey the laws of physics that He has ordained.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the starlight in the darkest nights, we're reminded of Your unwavering presence in our lives. Help us to trust in Your sovereignty, even when our circumstances seem bleak. May we, like the stars, reflect Your light and glory to a world in need. Thank You for being a God who shows no partiality and accepts no bribes, but instead loves us unconditionally. We praise You for Your greatness and mighty power, and we ask that You guide us through the darkest nights, illuminating our path with Your starlight. Amen.",
