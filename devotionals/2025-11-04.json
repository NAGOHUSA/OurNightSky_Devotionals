Let the fields be jubilant, and everything in them; let all the trees of the forest sing for joy.\" - Psalm 96:11-12\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the night sky, we're reminded of the harmony that exists within God's creation. The celestial bodies, the earth, and all its inhabitants are interconnected, each playing their unique role in the grand symphony of life. The psalmist invites us to join in this cosmic celebration, to let our spirits rejoice and resonate with the beauty of the universe. Just as the stars and planets move in perfect rhythm, our lives can also be attuned to the rhythm of God's love and purpose.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the wonders of the night sky, tune our hearts to the celestial resonance that fills your creation. May our lives be a joyful expression of your harmony, and may we move in rhythm with your plan for us. Help us to resonate with your love and purpose, that we may be a symphony of praise to your glory. Fill us with the music of your presence, and let our spirits sing with the trees, the fields, and all the wonders of your universe. Amen.",
