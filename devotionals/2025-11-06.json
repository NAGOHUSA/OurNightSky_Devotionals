The phases of the moon - from new to full and back again - mirror the seasons of our faith journey. Just as the moon waxes and wanes, our trust in God ebbs and flows. In times of spiritual fullness, we feel close to God and confident in His plan. But during periods of darkness, we may wonder if He's still working in our lives. Yet, just as the moon is always present, even when we can't see it, God is constantly with us, guiding us through every phase of our journey.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, thank you for the lunar cycles that remind us of the seasons of our faith. Help us to trust in Your presence, even when we can't feel it. As the moon waxes and wanes, may our faith grow stronger, illuminating the path ahead. May we find comfort in Your constant presence, and may our hearts remain fixed on You, the unwavering Light of our lives. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.",
