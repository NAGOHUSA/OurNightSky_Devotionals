I praise you because I am fearfully and wonderfully made; your works are wonderful, I know that full well.\" - Psalm 139:13-14\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the night sky, we're reminded that the same elements found in the stars are also present within us. The carbon, oxygen, and iron that make up our bodies were forged in the hearts of distant stars. This realization can evoke a sense of awe and wonder, as we consider the intricate connection between the celestial world and our own human experience. Just as the universe is full of purpose and design, our lives are also imbued with sacred purpose. We are fearfully and wonderfully made, crafted by the divine hand of our Creator.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we ponder the majesty of the stars and the vastness of the universe, we're reminded of the intricate beauty and purpose that you've woven into every aspect of creation, including our own lives. Help us to embrace our sacred purpose, to trust in your sovereignty, and to shine like stars in the darkness, reflecting your glory and love to a world in need. May our lives be a testament to your wonderful works, and may we ever be mindful of the incredible gift of life that you've given us. Amen.",
