The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it.\" - John 1:4-5\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the night sky during a lunar eclipse, we're reminded that even in the darkest moments, God's light shines through. The moon, once full and bright, is temporarily obscured by the earth's shadow, yet it doesn't lose its inherent glow. Similarly, in our lives, we may face seasons of darkness, uncertainty, or struggle, but God's presence remains unwavering. His light continues to shine, even when we can't see it, guiding us through the darkest of times.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, thank you for the reminder that your light is always present, even in the darkest moments. Help us to trust in your sovereignty and guidance, even when our circumstances seem to obscure your presence. May we, like the moon, reflect your light to a world in need, and may our faith be strengthened as we navigate life's challenges. Shine your light in our hearts, and may we overcome the darkness with your eternal hope and love. Amen.",
