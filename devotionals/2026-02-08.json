With all wisdom and understanding, he made known to us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure, which he purposed in Christ, to be put into effect when the times reach their fulfillment—to bring unity to all things in heaven and on earth under Christ.\" - Ephesians 1:7-10\n\n## Reflection\nAs we gaze up at the night sky, we're reminded of the vastness of God's creation. The stars, galaxies, and nebulas stretch out before us like an endless canvas, painting a picture of God's infinite power and wisdom. But there's more to the universe than what we can see. Beyond the reaches of our telescopes and spacecraft, there lies a spiritual realm, hidden from our physical eyes. In this realm, God is working to bring unity to all things, reconciling heaven and earth under the lordship of Christ.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we ponder the mysteries of the universe, we're reminded of the even greater mystery of your love and redemption. Thank you for lavishing your grace upon us and for revealing your will to us through Christ. Help us to catch a glimpse of the unity you're bringing to all things, and may our lives reflect the harmony and beauty of your creation. As we look up at the stars, may our hearts be filled with wonder, awe, and a deepening love for you. Amen.",
