Each star, planet, and galaxy has its own unique purpose, woven together by the Master Creator. Similarly, our lives are part of a larger cosmic narrative, with every thread intentionally placed by God. Even in the darkest moments, we can trust that He is working everything out for our good. Just as the universe operates under physical laws, our lives are governed by spiritual principles that guide us toward His purpose.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, help us to see our lives as part of Your grand cosmic tapestry. Weave our threads together with those around us, and use us to reveal Your glory in the universe. Even when we don't understand the darkness, give us faith to trust in Your sovereign plan. May we reflect Your light in the midst of evil, and may Your purpose be fulfilled in our lives, for Your glory and our good. Amen.",
