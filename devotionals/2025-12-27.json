The stars twinkling like diamonds against the dark canvas evoke a sense of longing within us. It's as if our souls are yearning for something more, something beyond the reach of our earthly lives. This celestial longing is a reflection of our deep-seated desire to connect with the infinite and eternal God. Just as the morning star rises in the east, guiding us towards a new day, Jesus is our guiding light, illuminating the path to salvation and eternal life.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we marvel at the beauty of the night sky, we're reminded of your infinite nature and sovereignty over all creation. Help us to surrender our longings to you, that we may be filled with the light of Christ. May our lives reflect the radiance of your love, shining like beacons in the darkness, guiding others to the eternal hope that lies in you. As we navigate the journey of life, may we hold fast to the promise that your salvation will reach to the end of the earth, and that we are part of your grand plan to bring light to the nations. Amen.",
