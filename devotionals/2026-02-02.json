The stars, the planets, and the galaxies all declare the glory of our Creator. Just as the cosmic horizon stretches out before us, our lives are filled with unknowns and uncertainties. But in the midst of these mysteries, we can find comfort in the fact that God is sovereign over all creation. The same God who spoke the stars into existence is the same God who guides us through life's journey. As we navigate the twists and turns of our path, we can trust that God is working everything out for our good.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we gaze up at the night sky, we're reminded of your majesty and power. Help us to trust in your sovereignty, even when the road ahead is uncertain. Give us the courage to embrace the unknown, knowing that you are guiding us every step of the way. May the beauty of your creation inspire us to worship and praise you, and may we reflect your glory to a world in need of your light. Amen.",
