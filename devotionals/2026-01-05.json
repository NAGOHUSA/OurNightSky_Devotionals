The stars, like diamonds scattered across the velvet expanse, twinkling with a light that has traveled across the vast distances of space. Just as the stars shine with a light that originated from a distant past, our lives as believers are meant to shine with the light of God's love, reflecting the beauty and wonder of His character. As a royal priesthood, we are called to declare the praises of God, who has brought us out of the darkness of sin and into the wonderful light of His presence.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we stargaze and ponder the wonders of Your creation, help us to remember our role as Your chosen people, called to shine with the light of Your love. May our lives reflect the beauty and wonder of Your character, and may we declare Your praises to a world in need of Your light. Fill us with the wonder of Your creation, and empower us to share Your love with those around us, that they may see the light of Your presence shining through us. Amen.",
