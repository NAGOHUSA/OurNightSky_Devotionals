The stars and planets we see are like milestones on a grand cosmic map, guiding us towards our eternal destination. Just as astronauts navigate through the vast expanse of space, we navigate through life's challenges and uncertainties. But our ultimate goal is not a physical place, but a spiritual one - the city of God, where love, joy, and peace reign supreme.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, we thank you for the celestial map that guides us on our journey. Help us to keep our eyes fixed on the city that is to come, where you will wipe away every tear and sorrow. Give us the courage and perseverance to navigate life's challenges, knowing that you are our constant companion and guide. May the beauty of the night sky remind us of the beauty of our eternal home, and may we live each day with hope and longing for the city that is to come. Amen.",
