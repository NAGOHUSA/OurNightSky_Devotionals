The stars and galaxies we see today are a snapshot of the past, their light having traveled vast distances to reach us. This celestial tapestry is a testament to God's eternal nature, where a thousand years are but a fleeting moment. Just as the universe is governed by laws of physics, our lives are governed by the rhythms of time, with each passing day and season a reminder of our mortality. Yet, in God's sight, time is relative, and our brief journey is woven into the grand narrative of eternity.\n\n## Prayer\nDear Heavenly Father, as we contemplate the vast expanse of time and space, we're humbled by the brevity of our lives. Help us to cherish each moment, to seek your wisdom, and to trust in your sovereignty. May we find comfort in the knowledge that our lives, though short, are part of a larger tapestry, woven into the fabric of eternity. Guide us to live with purpose, to cherish every season, and to look forward to the day when time itself will be no more. In Jesus' name, we pray. Amen.",
